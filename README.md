# Angular Pairing Training exercise with the Gilded Rose problem

This is an implementation of
[Emily Bache's Gilded Rose refactoring kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)
in an Angular front-end app, since Angular uses Jasmine for testing.  Perhaps one day I'll submit
this as a PR to the original repo.
